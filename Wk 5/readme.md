<h1>Pitch Presentation</h1> 

Presenting, 'Hypnotic Sleep' I've now come to a completely speculative concept that will hopefully not be too ambitious. 

INPUT - Sleep 
PROCESS - Hypnosis 
OUTPUT - Healthy, happy you. 

Looking into different sound artists/ composers, I loved the work of: 

- Alvin Lucier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXgGfuLztXo">Music on a thin wire</a> which is a piece constructed by pulling on metal through a space, whereby the vibrations of the metal is sustained and resonates within a space, creating a hypnotic tone that can be manipulated by the users. 

- Marco Fusinato, another musician/ sound artist within his exhibition <a href="http://marcofusinato.com/art/mass-black-implosion/">Mass Black Implosion</a> takes each note from a piece and allows you to envision them as sound altogether. 

- Ryoji Ikeda, The ability to rid someone of their senses or holt their propriocentric motor functions, Ryoji Ikeda utilises this overwhelming sensation and theory within his large scales pieces like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omDK2Cm2mwo">The Transfinite</a>. Through large scale lightshows, the viewer undertakes an overwhelming sensory overload, which robs the body of all their prior thought processes and cleanses them to surrender to the space.

- Phil Niblock, Another artist who adopts mesmerism in their practice is Phil Niblock, he says “it takes 20-25 minutes for you to be amerced within a piece”, his minimalist sound/videoscapes eg. His piece <a href="https://www.ubu.com/film/niblock_movement.html">‘The Movement of People Working’</a> is a combination of dissipated chords musically, and shot 16mm film projections, described as a hypnotic tapestry of filmed repetitive gestures in diversified cultural situations. Again this process of hypnosis through repetition and sound. 

Adapting these elements, we can incorporate sound and contemporary composition that is determined by an electroencephalogram (EEG), to counteract a persons triggered beta state, reading the EEG scans, we see the brain oscillations change from a sleep state. The system will be activated, and a piece will play and hopefully reverse the progression. Using a Muse2, as my reader I’ll be capable of reading these brainwaves and run them through processing using Python, to then generate a capable system. Fingers crossed it works!
