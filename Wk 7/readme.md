<h1>Week 7</h1> 
This week we learnt to create pseudo code, and how you need INPUT's and variable (IF, ELSE IF) 
<h2>Content: Psuedo Code</h2> 
Further developing my idea to create a form of diary, it has now progressed to a form of daily planner whereby the USER uses their own INPUTS, and then presses START. Everything that takes place after start is randomised, and yet calculates the hours in a day, to then interject it's own series of tasks. Your inputs may consist of things you HAVE to do/ how long you must spend on them, and things you COULD do if you set aside a little bit of time. I must look to create the interface and somehow incorperate this into a form of psuedo code. 
<h1>What am I doing</h1>
Thus far progress has been **far too slow**, and I'm eager now to experiement and further understand what my project is, and how to use processing efficiently. 




<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>

**PseudoCode Mockup:** 

 INT time; 
 
 INT daily activites; 

 VAR most important tasks, favourite songs, favourite daily workout routine, favourite stretch, random tasks, least favourite song, least favourite activites

 IF (working){
 
 Time since start = TRUE < 35 mins
 
 INT favourite song = 5 mins
 
 } 
 ELSE IF (still working, continue button clicked){ 
 
 INT 35 mins
