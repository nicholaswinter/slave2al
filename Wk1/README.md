<h1>FIRST CLASS</h1> 
<p> Here we began the journey. Starting with drawn faces, and further developing our knowledge of Javascript. Karen started with a powerpoint that highlighted some key artsits in the generative art field. Those whom appealed to me were: 
  
 - Ryoji Ikeda(scale, aesthetic, use of JSON, use of lighting), 
 - Eska Rex (Use of machine learning, machine drawing, scale, use of time) - The form is so soft, and supple, yet is a generative art piece that explores form and space. 
 - Leo Fidjeland and Linnea Våglund (Distopian VS Utopian relationships, how can these paradoxs be visualised, how can you marry the two), 
 - Jean Tinguely， his pieces provide an abstraction of machine form, that are then transformed into functioning public exhibitions (water fountains, or sculptures). 
 - Teiji Furuhashi - specifically his installation <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1652">Lovers</a> is a movement piece, that evaluates those whom move within the space. The data is analysed and then read to match the human form. 
 
 My face I created initially was shocking... Its the start of my coding journey. Hopefully this works out well.
