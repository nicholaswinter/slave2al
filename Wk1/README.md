<h1>FIRST CLASS</h1> 
<p> Here we began the journey. Starting with drawn faces, and further developing our knowledge of Javascript. Karen started with a powerpoint that highlighted some key artsits in the generative art field. Those whom appealed to me were: 
  
 - Ryoji Ikeda(scale, aesthetic, use of JSON, use of lighting), 
 - Eska Rex (Use of machine learning, machine drawing, scale, use of time) - The form is so soft, and supple, yet is a generative art piece that explores form and space. 
 - Leo Fidjeland and Linnea Våglund (Distopian VS Utopian relationships, how can these paradoxs be visualised, how can you marry the two), 
 - Jean Tinguely， his pieces provide an abstraction of machine form, that are then transformed into functioning public exhibitions (water fountains, or sculptures). 
 - Teiji Furuhashi - specifically his installation <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1652">Lovers</a> is a movement piece, that evaluates those whom move within the space. The data is analysed and then read to match the human form. 
 
We were instructed to create portraits, this process took a hot sec, as I really struggled figuring out the dimensions, rather than just playing I got super frustrated and this, yes, did impede the outcome. My face I created initially was shocking... Its the start of my coding journey. I really struggle with arithmatic and math so I'm worried this may hinder me in the long run. I shall persist! Hopefully this works out well. 

<h2>Assignment PREP</h2> 
My first assignment, although far away purely speculative. I'm eager to explore the use of sound and hypnosis. As a previous composer and sound designer, I'm keen to see how this exploration goes. Yet, I'm also very intruiged by typography and would love to create a piece typographic based.
