<h1> Week 11: New Vision </h1>

Within this code, I'm utilising the abstraction of text, via the RiTa library. It's recognised each individual word, what it's attribute is, and or it's part-of-speech context (eg. jj, Adjective, vb, Verb (base form), nn, Noun (singular or mass)). These identifiers provide the code with the leeway to further create compiled random sentences. I'm unsure as to how to construct these as of yet... But I'm think of using these trials as a means to creating a design tool, with which I can use randomised type/ textures/ with adjustments to create graphics. It's sad that I've let go the cultural communications idea as I think that that system would've created a product worthwhile and relevent to my design practice, however, I'm eager to persist in coming months on that project.

<h3>Menu addition</h3> 

This menu addition consists of both the 'collage make', and the 'collage chat' functions, whereby one is to create the design through user input, whereas the other the input is their speech. This contrast allows for enjoyable interaction, and the scope to discover unexplored possibilities for type setting. I'm yet to still add buttons/ sliders/ other elements to adapt the already random design. Considering this concept idea came quite late in this process, I've learnt that my commitment issues within assignment based pieces are not as well researched/ developed/ have the gravitas I would usually show within my work.

<h2>User Interface Design</h2> 

I managed to complete the landing pages before managing to attach them to the actual product! The coordinates I really struggled with, but managed to fix them to get a cohesive outcome.
