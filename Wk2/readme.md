Personally, having mentioned mental health this week, in the form of anxiety interests me. Even dreams. Anxious dreams and how can I create a system them that looks to correct these anxieties through music or white noise? Including visuals, colours or patterns to help your 'sleep state'? This would interest me most - Creating atmospheres in which allows a being to enter their sleep without hestiations or distracting thoughts, a program that can detect when those thoughts are triggered, and then counteract them. 

<h3>Example artists</h3> 

- Piet Mondrian, his style and art form graphically intruiges me. Utilising this kind of randomised Mondrian program could be interesting? Create a tool for graphics! 
- Sol Lewitt 
- Yoko Ono
- Manfred Mohr 
- Roman Verosko
- Harold Cohen Aaron 
- Samuel C Monier 
- Jean Pierre Herbert
