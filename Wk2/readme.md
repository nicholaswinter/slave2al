<h1>Wk 2</h1>  

Honestly coming upon reflection, I found processing quite difficult to understand in regards to how the coding language reads. I've started on CodeAcademy and SoloLearn to aquire more skills, and practice code. 

<h2>CheatSheet Dimensions</h2> 

- Line: 0,0 STARTING POINT 0,0 ENDING 

- Rect: 0,0 WHERE(can insert mouse), 0,0 SIZE 

<h3>Notable Artists</h3>**Aesthetically**: 


- Ryoji Ikeda 

- Raven Kwow

- Steve Reich <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71A_sm71_BI">Music for 18 Musicians.</a> This piece is a demonstration of chance, practice and coordination, a piece that feels generative in sound, yet also hypnotic (a piece I would like to develop a project around. It's already a system and I can utilise the sheet music to create my final product. A depiction of sound... 

Personally, having mentioned mental health this week, in the form of anxiety interests me. Even dreams. Anxious dreams and how can I create a system them that looks to correct these anxieties through music or white noise? Including visuals, colours or patterns to help your 'sleep state'? This would interest me most - Creating atmospheres in which allows a being to enter their sleep without hestiations or distracting thoughts, a program that can detect when those thoughts are triggered, and then counteract them. 

<h3>Example artists</h3> 

- Piet Mondrian, his style and art form graphically intruiges me. Utilising this kind of randomised Mondrian program could be interesting? Create a tool for graphics! 
- Sol Lewitt 
- Yoko Ono
- Manfred Mohr 
- Roman Verosko
- Harold Cohen Aaron 
- Samuel C Monier 
- Jean Pierre Herbert 

<h3>Experiment</h3> 

I experimented with a code from Daniel Shiffman **The Coding Train**, which looked at a starfield. I find it ironic as I think I aimed too high with this tutorial and didn't learn too much aside from the fact that taking parts from others code may be far too complicated than just creating your own. It's a beautiful graphic, I'm just not sure if I'll be able to use this in my final product. Even then, my final code is broken and I couldn't create the proper Starfield... Back to the drawing board.
