<h1>Wk 3</h1> 

Problem solving, and drawing machines. 

Understanding how a drawing machine can be constructed, creating automatic bio technological markings. 

<h2>Trial #1</h2> 

- String, 
- Markers, 
- Cardboard, 
- Shower head, 
- Myself. 

It was not self automated, however the markings were imprinted at random due to the lack of control over the string. Further this, I looked to a different mode of mark making. 

<h2>Trial #2</h2> 

- Dryer, 
- Watercolours,
- Water,
- Cardboard, 
- Myself. 

With the process of turning on the dryer, and then laid beneath was my card and colours that were spread from the force of the heat/ wind. Applying water at the same time allowed for the process to be elongated. 

<h2>Example Artists:</h2> 

- Eske Rex
- Karina Smigla-Bobinski
- Joseph Griffiths 
- David Shingler
- Leo Fidjeland & Linnea Vaglund
- Jean Tinguely
- Greg Kuoera 
- Thomas Forsyth
- Sol Lewitt

Pitch thinking: 
What is it that defines my project? Resolution of Anxiety and Thought. 
What does my product do? 
I must argue/ speculate the plausibility. Gathering support for the assignment, remember INPUT - PROCESS - OUTPUT. 
Andy "project = technology (possibility) t + blue-sky x life experience/interest" 
The pitch is to create a program that recognises anxiety and counteracts that with your choice of colour or sound. Through a series of tests, the device should be able to recognise when the thoughts change and then counteract this.

HW: 
Create a mockup pre next week to present as an "idea", as speculating the idea without the effort to visualise it doesn't allow someone to fully understand the abstraction. *Speak to an object* A depiction of what you're abstracting. 

Personal thoughts/ Readings: 
Carl G. Jung, Man and His Symbols, this is an interesting examination of how we understand symbols.
