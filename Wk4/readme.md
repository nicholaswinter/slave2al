<h2>Processing Text experiments/ Outcomes from WK3 Drawing Machine Experiment</h2> 

The process of nature/ human collaboration required an instigator, a process which once activated then produces an outcome. Today we looked to further experiment with this process. Primarily inspired by Eska Rex whom made a drawing machine. I first explored the classic texter from a height. I wrapped it around the shower head and used that as my means to draw, however I thought I could be a little more creative. I explored the use of paint/ watercolour and water, but also heat! Combining these processes I used the hand-dryer to naturally push the paint. This created a single use effect that didn't fufill my need to aquire a naturally instigated visual reaction. So, knowing it was raining for the next several weeks, I left the board out in the rain and collected some interesting data/ visuals that pleased the need.

<h2>Assignment 1</h2> 

Looking at sound, I've been analysing Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians and I think I have a plan. To make my own composition, whereby the inputs are my day-to-day activities/ the times I have them and then that correclates with a music note. The notes/ sections of the day, could create a chord which I can use in a sequence, ultimately creating composition. Still interested in Hypnosis however, I'd be interested in creating a piece that triggers and stimulates the mind into a Theta stage, ready for sleep. 

<h2>Processing Experiments</h2> 
Extending our Processing skills this week, we looked at picture generation as well as text manipulation. These experiments sparked my interest in typography, and how it can be generated in diverse visual ways. 

<h3>Attempt 1, Picture Generation</h3>
