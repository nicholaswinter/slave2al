<h2>Processing Text experiments</h2> 

The process of nature/ human collaboration required an instigator, a process which once activated then produces an outcome. Today we looked to further experiment with this process. Primarily inspired by Eska Rex whom made a drawing machine. I first explored the classic texter from a height. I wrapped it around the shower head and used that as my means to draw, however I thought I could be a little more creative. I explored the use of paint/ watercolour and water, but also heat! Combining these processes I used the hand-dryer to naturally push the paint. This created a single use effect that didn't fufill my need to aquire a naturally instigated visual reaction. So, knowing it was raining for the next several weeks, I left the board out in the rain and collected some interesting data/ visuals that pleased the need.

<h2>Assignment 1</h2> 

Looking at sound, I've been analysing Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians and I think I have a plan. To make my own composition, whereby the inputs are my day-to-day activities/ the times I have them and then that correclates with a music note. The notes/ sections of the day, could create a chord which I can use in a sequence, ultimately creating composition. Still interested in Hypnosis however, I'd be interested in creating a piece that triggers and stimulates the mind into a Theta stage, ready for sleep.
