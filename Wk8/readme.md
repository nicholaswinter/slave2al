<h1>Week 8</h1> 
<h2>Project Progression</h2> 

Gotta say, now that I've morphed my idea into something that I feel is maybe achievable within the time limit, I'm scared. For some reason the coding side of everything just isn't clicking, and I cannot seem to find my groove. However, making a daily planner that still utilises this idea of random thought, random tasks, and using an input like the RiTa library may be the way to go... Using RiTa creative, I've found several ways of utilising type that may help further this project. Not sure if I'm set on this PvP idea, (Play Vs Practical), but I'll try make it work. However, I'm looking to make a system that incorperate Mandarin, Chinese. Having spent time on SoloLearn with HTML code this week, I've done tutorials crafting web pages; the hierarchies and the layouts. 

<h3>Pseudo Paper/Electronic Prototype</h3> 

The balls chosen dictate the daily planner and in which order the events are to proceed.

Even though having these notes as a reference is helpful, it has still taken time to settle. Like anything, it takes time to digest before it suddenly clicks! And all the inner workings finally make sense... Hahah
