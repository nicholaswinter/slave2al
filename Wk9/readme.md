<h1>Week 9 Progress</9> 

<h2>New Concept</h2> 
I've developed the concept, and have decided to extend research towards translation and expressive typography.

<h1>Coding</h1> 

In terms of coding this beast, I've looked into how I may be able to incorperate live Chinese translation. After this fridays tutorial with Karen and with Shuchen's knowledge, they were able to constuct speech.js. Which was a GAME CHANGER, I appreciated this tutorial so much... and have been playing with it ever since. This being said, I'm now leaning towards an expressive translator, that has the ability to use a colour legend to identify expressive thought/ speech/ tonal quality, that in-turn should be able to develop ambiguity within intercultural/ intracultural/ cross-culture communications. I believe that within cultural communications, there's a lot of accidental misunderstanding due to the nature of peoples cultural background. Whereby, we're tasked to understand completely polarising perspectives and further share stories and experiences of how life. Especially here within Australia, a country built on the land of others, multiculturalism runs deep, as it is our job to demonstrate open minded behaviour everyday. I quote an essay by Shi (2006) which relates moreso towards our education system, however in essence this speaks to what I'm trying to achieve... "classroom teachers may offer intercultural communication courses, that include both native and non-native students, which may provide a favourable platform for intercultural interaction and the examination of culturally bound practices.’, she further states, ‘Representing different cultures, all students can benefit, by helping each other to examine the underlying roots of potential and actual miscommunications in a two-tiered way, by examining not just the “ways things are often said” but also the underlying ideologies that lead to “interpretations of meaning” based on a particular worldview. Collective intercultural reflexivity can construct a rich zone of collaboration to break unhealthy stereotypes and facilitate students’ development in intercultural communicative competence, which would be beneficial to all participants.’
