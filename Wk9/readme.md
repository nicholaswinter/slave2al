<h1>Coding</h1> 

In terms of coding this beast, I've looked into how I may be able to incorperate live Chinese translation. After this fridays tutorial with Karen and with Shuchen's knowledge, they were able to constuct speech.js. Which was a GAME CHANGER, I appreciated this tutorial so much... and have been playing with it ever since. This being said, I'm now leaning towards an expressive translator, that has the ability to use a colour legend to identify expressive thought/ speech/ tonal quality, that intern should be able to extend intercultural/ intracultural/ cross-culture communications.
